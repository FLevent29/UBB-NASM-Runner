# UBB NASM Runner

Console application that makes the life of certain UBB students a tiny bit easier.
It compiles and runs and tests assembly project files **at the press of a single button**,
instead of having to struggle with all those pesky terminal commands.

> Note: It places your project files into a new folder called `\projects`, so your open editor might say that your open files are missing

> Note: Chances are you still need to know how to compile/link/run a project for **exams**, so make sure you don't take this program for granted
