# UBB NASM Runner

Program that makes the life of certain UBB students a tiny bit easier.
It compiles and runs and tests assembly project files at the press of a single button,
instead of having to struggle with all those pesky terminal commands.

> Note: Chances are you still need to know how to compile/link/run a project for the exam so make sure you don't take this program for granted
